            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Education, the conduit of knowledge, skills, and character, encompasses diverse forms.
                Formal education thrives within structured institutional settings, like public schools,
                while non-formal education extends beyond these boundaries. Informal education, unstructured
                and spontaneous, evolves through daily life experiences. These educational avenues span various levels,
                from early childhood to tertiary education, and encompass a spectrum of subjects, from science to language
                and physical education.<br><br>The main field investigating education is called education studies. It examines what
                education is, what aims and effects it has, and how to improve it. Education studies has many subfields,
                like philosophy, psychology, sociology, and economics of education. It also discusses comparative
                education, pedagogy, and the history of education. In prehistory, education happened informally through
                oral communication and imitation. With the rise of ancient civilizations, writing was invented, and the
                amount of knowledge grew. This caused a shift from informal to formal education. Initially, formal
                education was mainly available to elites and religious groups. <br><br>The invention of the printing press in
                the 15th century made books more widely available. This increased general literacy. Beginning in the
                18th and 19th centuries, public education became more important. It led to the worldwide process of
                making primary education available to all, free of charge, and compulsory up to a certain age.</p>

            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Education in India is primarily managed by the state-run public
                education system, which falls under the command of the government at three levels: central, state and
                local. Under various articles of the Indian Constitution and the Right of Children to Free and
                Compulsory Education Act, 2009, free and compulsory education is provided as a fundamental right to
                children aged 6 to 14. The approximate ratio of the total number of public schools to private schools in
                India is 10:3.<br><br>Education in India covers different levels and types of learning, such as early
                childhood education, primary education, secondary education, higher education, and vocational education.
                It varies significantly according to different factors, such as location (urban or rural), gender,
                caste, religion, language, and disability.<br><br>Education in India faces many challenges and
                opportunities, such as improving access and quality, reducing disparities and dropouts, increasing
                enrolment and completion rates, enhancing learning outcomes and employability, strengthening governance
                and accountability, promoting innovation and technology, and addressing the impact of COVID-19 pandemic.
                It is influenced by various policies and programmes at the national and state levels, such as the
                National Education Policy 2020, the Samagra Shiksha Abhiyan, the Rashtriya Madhyamik Shiksha Abhiyan,
                the Midday Meal Scheme, the Beti Bachao Beti Padhao Scheme, and the National Digital Education
                Architecture. It is also supported by various stakeholders and partners, such as UNICEF, UNESCO, World
                Bank, civil society organizations, academic institutions, private sector entities, and media outlets.

            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Educate Together is an educational charity in Ireland which is the
                patron body to "equality-based, co-educational, child centred, and democratically run" schools.It was
                founded in 1984 to act as the patron body for the new multidenominational schools that opened after the
                establishment of the Dalkey School Project. As of 2019, Educate Together is the patron of 90 national
                schools in Ireland. In 2014 three Educate Together Second Level Schools opened in Dublin 15, Drogheda
                and Lucan along with the first Educate Together school outside Ireland, in Bristol in the United
                Kingdom. In joint patronage with Kildare and Wicklow ETB, Educate Together opened another second-level
                school, Celbridge Community School, in 2015.<br><br>Defining education precisely is subject to debate, 
                with differing perspectives on its aims and distinctions from indoctrination. These discussions impact 
                how we identify, evaluate, and enhance educational practices. Education fundamentally shapes individuals, 
                integrating them into society's fabric by instilling cultural values and essential skills for societal
                contribution, thereby fostering economic growth and global awareness.<br><br>Historically, education 
                transitioned from informal oral traditions to formalized systems, spurred by the advent of writing 
                and later the printing press. Public education emerged in the 18th and 19th centuries, democratizing
                access and fostering literacy on a global scale</p>
